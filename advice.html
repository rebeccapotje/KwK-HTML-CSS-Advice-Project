      <h3> The Night Before </h3>
      <p> We get it. You're going to be nervous the night before camp. The best you can do is get a good night's sleep. Make sure you have everything packed and ready to go. On the morning of the big day, we would recommend having a good breakfast. While you are on your way to camp, make sure you have a good attitude and be friendly. </p>

      <h3> First Day </h3>
        <p>Before you arrive, don't worry, everthing is going to be fun! Try to arrive early so you have enough time to get signed in, find a seat, and say hi to the other girls. Keep an open mind, since a lot of the information is going to be new to you. Don't panic if you fall behind and need to ask for help, most likely there will be other girls in your same situation. If you are confused about something don't be afraid to speak up and ask the teacher, they love to answer your questions. We know 9 to 5 may seem really long, but it will go by quickly. Plus you'll get fun breaks in between lessons! </p>
